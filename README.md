# whatodo

This todo app is a small project designed to provide a simple and easy-to-follow example of building a CRUD
(Create, Read, Update, Delete) application with a frontend and backend using modern tools and technologies.
The project will grow organically through different milestones, adding new libraries and Spring modules as I accomplish previous goals.
The focus will be on learning, and unnecessary details will be avoided to keep the app as barebone as possible.
### Focus Areas
- Java 
- JUnit 
- Spring Framework
- Spring Web 
- Spring Data JPA 
- JavaScript
- React with Vite
